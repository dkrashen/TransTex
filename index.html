    <p>TransTex is a command-line tool for transforming tex template files
    into tex files with the aid of auxiliary data files in yaml format.</p>
    <p> TransTex supports the inclusion of special tags `\ttvar{name} or
    \ttblock{command}. These are simply interpreted as jinja2 tags, which
    are then processed by TransTex in order to produce a standard tex file
    using a specified yaml datafile for the jinja2 templating.  </p>
